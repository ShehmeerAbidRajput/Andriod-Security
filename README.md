# Android-Security

Welcome to the **Android-Security** repository! This project is intended to provide various security tools, scripts, and resources that can be used to audit, analyze, or secure Android applications. While the primary focus is on Android security, this repository can also include multi-platform scripts (for example, analyzing DLL files) within the `HelperFunctions` directory.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Equip developers, researchers, and enthusiasts with scripts and techniques to identify and mitigate security threats in Android apps.
- **Structure**:
  - **HelperFunctions/**: A folder containing utility scripts, such as `DLL_parser.py`, that may be useful for analyzing certain aspects of Android or cross-platform modules.

Currently, the main script here is `DLL_parser.py`, which can be used to search for specific strings in DLL files (even though DLLs typically pertain to Windows applications, this script demonstrates how you can search binary files for patterns that might impact Android security indirectlyâ€”for instance, if an Android app loads certain libraries via native code).
